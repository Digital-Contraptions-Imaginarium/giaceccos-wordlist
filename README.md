==================

##What is it?
This repository includes the source code in R to create Giacecco's Wordlist: a British English word list suitable for use with a 6-dice diceware method, and the list itself in text and PDF formats.

Read more about the diceware method [here](http://boingboing.net/2015/07/31/dice.html).

The word list is derived from Geoffrey Leech, Paul Rayson and Andrew Wilson's "List 1.1", that is the complete list of the whole spoken and written British English corpus as specified in their "Word Frequencies in Written and Spoken English: based on the British National Corpus" book, 1st edition (23 July 2001), published by Routledge. The original files are available at [http://ucrel.lancs.ac.uk/bncfreq/flists.html](http://ucrel.lancs.ac.uk/bncfreq/flists.html) (last accessed 14 August 2015).
